# SQL-Studies
This repository documents my SQL learning journey through the book Learning SQL by Alan Beaulieu, including practice queries, notes, and key concepts learned along the way against the Sakila DataBase.

Note: I started documenting my learning from Chapter 9 (Subqueries) ownard, as earlier chapters covered basic concepts I had already practiced before.
